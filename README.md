# ðŸš— Explorer Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP)  
*By Sahil Jartare*  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  

The project is hosted by the [Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub](https://nebigdatahub.org/about) and the [National Student Data Corps (NSDC)](https://nebigdatahub.org/nsdc/), in collaboration with the [U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration](https://highways.dot.gov/).  

The goal of this project is to introduce learners to **data science fundamentals** through transportation-focused problems. Participants gain hands-on experience in **Python programming, data exploration, and applied machine learning**, while contributing to a larger community interested in making roads safer for vulnerable road users.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives  
- Apply the **Team Data Science Process (TDSP)** framework across six structured milestones.    
- Perform **data exploration, visualization, and cleaning** with Python libraries.  
- Analyze **transportation datasets** to uncover meaningful insights.  
- Develop skills in **modeling and evaluation** for applied research.  
- Connect data science techniques to **real-world transportation safety** outcomes.

## ðŸ§© TDSP Milestones  
This notebook is organized into six milestones. Each milestone may take between 1â€“5 hours depending on prior experience:  

1. **Business Understanding** â€“ Identify transportation safety challenges and research questions.  
2. **Data Acquisition** â€“ Collect or access relevant transportation datasets.  
3. **Data Exploration** â€“ Generate descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
4. **Data Preparation** â€“ Clean, preprocess, and transform data for analysis.  
5. **Modeling** â€“ Apply machine learning techniques to test hypotheses.  
6. **Evaluation & Insights** â€“ Interpret results and connect them to road safety solutions.
