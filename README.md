# 🚗 Explorer Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP)  
*By Sahil Jartare*  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains the notebook **Explorer_TDSP_Sahil_Jartare.ipynb**, developed as part of the **Explorer Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP)**.  

The project is hosted by the [Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub](https://nebigdatahub.org/about) and the [National Student Data Corps (NSDC)](https://nebigdatahub.org/nsdc/), in collaboration with the [U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration](https://highways.dot.gov/).  

The goal of this project is to introduce learners to **data science fundamentals** through transportation-focused problems. Participants gain hands-on experience in **Python programming, data exploration, and applied machine learning**, while contributing to a larger community interested in making roads safer for vulnerable road users.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
- Apply the **Team Data Science Process (TDSP)** framework across six structured milestones.  
- Learn the basics of **Python** and **Google Colab** for interactive programming.  
- Perform **data exploration, visualization, and cleaning** with Python libraries.  
- Analyze **transportation datasets** to uncover meaningful insights.  
- Develop skills in **modeling and evaluation** for applied research.  
- Connect data science techniques to **real-world transportation safety** outcomes.

## 🧩 TDSP Milestones  
This notebook is organized into six milestones. Each milestone may take between 1–5 hours depending on prior experience:  

1. **Business Understanding** – Identify transportation safety challenges and research questions.  
2. **Data Acquisition** – Collect or access relevant transportation datasets.  
3. **Data Exploration** – Generate descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
4. **Data Preparation** – Clean, preprocess, and transform data for analysis.  
5. **Modeling** – Apply machine learning techniques to test hypotheses.  
6. **Evaluation & Insights** – Interpret results and connect them to road safety solutions.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
You will need:  
- A Google account (to run the notebook in **Google Colab**).  
- Or, a local Python 3.8+ environment with:  
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  ```  

### Running the Notebook in Colab  
1. Open the notebook file: **Explorer_TDSP_Sahil_Jartare.ipynb**.  
2. Select **File → Save a copy in Drive**.  
3. Rename it (e.g., `Explorer_TDSP_YourName`).  
4. Run each cell step by step to follow the guided workflow.  

### Running Locally  
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Explorer_TDSP_Sahil_Jartare.ipynb
   ```  
3. Execute cells sequentially.
